## Hi there üëã
# Craig Lawson - Portfolio
Hello! I‚Äôm Craig Lawson, a recent graduate with a BSc in Computing (Level 8) from Atlantic Technological University, Sligo, Ireland. I have a passion for software development, cybersecurity, and solving real-world problems with technology. With experience in IT support and retail management, I bring strong problem-solving and customer service skills to my technical work.

I‚Äôve worked on a variety of projects, from web development to facial recognition systems, which are all featured here on my GitHub. I‚Äôm always looking to improve my skills in areas like software development, algorithms, and cybersecurity.

# Projects
1. Facial Recognition Security System
A security system leveraging AWS Rekognition, Python, and Raspberry Pi 4 to perform facial recognition-based access control. The system utilizes a face detection screen and an electronic lock, which activates only after verifying authorized faces from an S3-stored database of images. The project includes integration with AWS services through API Gateway.

### Technologies: Python, AWS Rekognition, S3, API Gateway, Raspberry Pi
### Key Features: Facial recognition, physical lock control, secure image storage

2. WPF Activity Management Application
A desktop application created using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) in C# that allows users to manage and filter activities. The app supports filtering activities by category (Land, Water, Air), selecting activities, moving them between lists, and calculating the total cost. It also ensures users don‚Äôt select activities scheduled for the same date.

### Technologies: C#, WPF, ObservableCollection
### Key Features: Filtering, scheduling conflict management, total cost calculation
